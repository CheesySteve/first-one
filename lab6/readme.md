#### Executive Summary
This week we will be learning about internet architechture, HTML5 and CSS, and URLs and file paths. These components are important, not only for those working towards a web development career, but everyone to have a basic understanding of how the internet works. 
#### Internet Architecture
###### Internet Protocol
IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is that IPv4 is 32 bit and uses a numeric address, while the IPv6 is 128 bit and uses hexadecimal address.
ICANN is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.
###### TCP/IP
TCP/IP defines the details on how data is sent and recieved through network adapters, hubs, switches, and routers and other network communications. The client server model is like calling someone on the telephone. The clients connection on the computer or device is "making a call" and the server is "listing for the call".
Layered protocol stacks are important because single layer stacks are inflexible and any changes require the entire protocol software to be changed. With layers, one part can be changes without affecting the other layers. The application layer runs HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, and SNMP. These are email protocols and internet browser protocol.
###### Internet Security
HTTP is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages. It supports the client server model because with http, they would be little to no user interface between the client and server. Most servaces today are run by simply visiting a website. 
The protocols that secure data in http are called https. Instead of sending the data in plain text, it takes the data and encrypts it. So when sending sensitive data, it will be encrypted and safer from hackers.
###### Securing Your Web Browser
You should secure your browser because the average internet user will not be able to assess the threats from software attacks that take advantage of vulnerable web browsers. One risk is web pages that are disguised or take you to an unexpected site.
#### Internet Programming
###### World Wide Web Censoritum
Tim-Berners Lee is the creator of the world wide web and he created W3C to standardize web technologies. One standard that I believe is important is the mobile web. They have made technologies for using the web on devices like smart phones.
###### HTML5 and CSS
Unfortunately, I am not good with design and color schemes. I just picked some colors that I thought looked nice. Most people would probably disagree.
###### HTML5 and XML
XML is a markup language designed to store and transfer data. XML was designed to carry data while HTML was designed to show how data looks.
#### Components of a URL
scheme-https

domain-www.amazon.com

top level domain-.edu

default page-result of search

parameter-no file path provided

anchor-specific location on a page
#### Conclusion
This week is important for people who might want to get in to web development one day. Being able to design and create web sites is a big deal in todays world. I don't think many people understand how difficult it can be.
