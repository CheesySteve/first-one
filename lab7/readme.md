###### File Compression
The purpose of a zip file is to group and archive multiple files to act as one. Another advantage is that compressed files are smaller.
The original SVG graphic was originally 52.7 kb. When compressed, it went to 47.7 kb. I believe file sizes for JPG are larger and don't compress as much as SVG files do.
###### Object Orientated Programming
The methods are a defined function within a class. For the shark class, they are be awesome and swim. 
The constructor method is used to initilize data. It runs as soon as the object of a class is instantiated. 
Classes are like a blueprint that you define to use to create objects. An object is an instance in a class.
Instantiating an object means to create an object in a class.
