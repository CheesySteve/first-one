#### Executive Summary
###### File Compression
The purpose of a zip file is to group and archive multiple files to act as one. Another advantage is that compressed files are smaller.
The original SVG graphic was originally 52.7 kb. When compressed, it went to 47.7 kb. I believe file sizes for JPG are larger and don't compress as much as SVG files do.
