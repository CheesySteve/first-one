#### Executive Summary
This week we will learn about file compression, OOP and UML. File compression is handy tool for storing and moving data. OOP is an improtant model for programming language and most surely will be useful in the future. I am also sure UML will be very important in the future. It can be used to help visulize the design of a system.
###### File Compression
The purpose of a zip file is to group and archive multiple files to act as one. Another advantage is that compressed files are smaller.
The original SVG graphic was originally 52.7 kb. When compressed, it went to 47.7 kb. I believe file sizes for JPG are larger and don't compress as much as SVG files do.
###### Object Orientated Programming
The methods are a defined function within a class. For the shark class, they are be awesome and swim. 
The constructor method is used to initilize data. It runs as soon as the object of a class is instantiated. 
Classes are like a blueprint that you define to use to create objects. An object is an instance in a class.
Instantiating an object means to create an object in a class.
###### Unified Modeling Language
OMG is a not-for-profit technology standards consortium, founded in 1989. They oversee the definition and maintenance of UML specifications. UML are tools for analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems as well as for modeling business and similar processes.

Object - Sammy

The object in the shark class is Sammy.

Class - shark

The basic building block.

Abstraction - swim(self)

The behaivor of the shark is to swim.

Encapsulation - definition of a shark

Data that can be in the code but hidden.


Inheritance - specific type of shark

Can be made into a smaller class but still under the class shark.


#### Conclusion
This week we learned how to zip files. We learned the basics to object orientated programming. Learning about programming is very interesting to me and maybe what I will go into in the future. Lastly, we learned about UML. A very useful tool to help break down and visualize logic that otherwise would be difficult to understand.
