#### Executive Summary
This week we will look at Lucidchart. A tool used to make proffensional flow charts. We also get to look a little more into networks. How they work and some of the hardware that is used. Last we look at cybersecurity and encryption. Very important fields in todays world.
#### LucidChart
Lucidchart is fun experience. It can be a way to visualize and see how a computer is coded and makes decisions.
#### Introduction to Networking
###### Data Transmission
Packet - unit of data
Packet Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
IP Address - unique itentifying number
DNS - directory of common IP address common names
Protocol - set of rules to allow devices to communicate
Each is piece that is used together so we are able to use the internet.
###### Network Hardware
When a hub recieves data, it sends it to every device connected to the network. It can cause security issues and unwanted traffic. On the other hand, a switch learns the mac addresses of devices and sends the data to the specific device and that device only.
A router checks whether the IP address of the data packet was for its network or another network. If it was for its own network, it sends there, but if it's for another network, it routes the data packet to that network.
###### Network Topologies
Single point of failure is when just one device failing can shut down a network. The types of topologies that have a single point of failure are the star, bus, and ring.
The infrastructure and wireless mesh topologies are similar because they both use wireless networks. I would say that the wireless mesh topology is better because it has the advantages of the mesh topology without the problems of running wires.
###### Network Design
This design is based off of my home network. It resembles the infrastructure and star topology. While one device will not shut down the network, problems with the router or modem will. 
###### NSA/CSS
The NSA/CSS learn what adversaries do and what they are capable of in order to make plans and orders. They make communication and data transfers secure. And they must be able to outmaneuver those to do harm in cyberspace.
#### Cybersecurity and Encryption
###### Information Systems Security
b. Almost every day I use my debit card. This requires a 4 digit pass code. It could made into multi factor by requiring an ID. Another thing that needs authentication is my cell phone. To unlock it, I put in the 4 digit pass code. To make it multi factor I could aslo use the fingerprint scanner that is already built into the phone. Another task that requires authentication would be logging into my Tri-c account. All that is required is a username and password. It could be made more secure by requiring the user to show up in person at the library with an ID to log into there account.
c. With ACL's, for each user, specific capabilites are assigned. ACL's are simple but can be a disadvantage when an admin wants to set clearance to a large set of data. In RBAC, users are assigned to roles, then the roles are assigned to the access. This allows admins to manage users and roles seperately. 
d. When information needs to be sent but needs to be proteced, it can be encrypted. One way is the public key encryption. A public key is given to someone who wishes to send a message. They encrypt the message and then send it. The message becomes cyphertext and is becomes nonsense. The message is recieved and then decrypted with the private key.
e. Public key cryptography is important because it's an simple yet effictive way to protect and secure data.
###### Cryptography
The caesar cipher encryption - It results in random letters but the same amount of them.
The frequency fingerprint encryption - It lets you see how many of each letter is used. I think it would be different in other languages, especially, if they have a different alphabet.
Polyalphabetic cipher uses substitution to encrypt messages. It takes shifts the letters used and can't be decrypted without knowing the shift word.
###### Brute Force
The brute force method allows hackers to use code to find the message that makes sense. If the message was encrypted and has relatively few keys, a hacker may be able to find the message.
#### Conclusion
I have learned a lot this week. Networks always seemed so confusing but this week cleared that up a little bit. Cybersecurity looks like a difficult field but an important one.
