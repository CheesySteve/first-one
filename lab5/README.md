#### Executive Summary

#### LucidChart
Lucidchart is fun experience. It can be a way to visualize and see how a computer is coded and makes decisions.
#### Introduction to Networking
###### Data Transmission
Packet - unit of data
Packet Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
IP Address - unique itentifying number
DNS - directory of common IP address common names
Protocol - set of rules to allow devices to communicate
Each is piece that is used together so we are able to use the internet.
###### Network Hardware
When a hub recieves data, it sends it to every device connected to the network. It can cause security issues and unwanted traffic. On the other hand, a switch learns the mac addresses of devices and sends the data to the specific device and that device only.
A router checks whether the IP address of the data packet was for its network or another network. If it was for its own network, it sends there, but if it's for another network, it routes the data packet to that network.
###### Network Topologies
Single point of failure is when just one device failing can shut down a network. The types of topologies that have a single point of failure are the star, bus, and ring.
The infrastructure and wireless mesh topologies are similar because they both use wireless networks. I would say that the wireless mesh topology is better because it has the advantages of the mesh topology without the problems of running wires.
###### Network Design
This design is based off of my home network. It resembles the infrastructure and star topology. While one device will not shut down the network, problems with the router or modem will.
