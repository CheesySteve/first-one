#### Executive Summary
#### Data, Information and Knowledge
###### Relational Data
Data are raw bits of information without context. Information is just data with context. Knowledge is taking the information, and analyzing it to make decisions.
The primary key for the customer could be an user id and for the order could be an order number. The customers and orders can be related through their user id and past orders. The foreign key for the orders table could be past orders. 
It is important to properly define the data field because the information can be more accurate and available.
###### Big Data
The four v's are volume, the amount of data collected, velocity, how much data movement there is, variety, the types of data, and veracity, the trustworthiness of the data.
Some of the technologies that have driven the need for big data are HDFS, Flume, Kafka, Storm, and Java Mapreduce.
###### Structured Query Language
Rdbms organizes data into related tables with unique keys identifying each table.
Two related fields are customer names and country. They are related by naming a country and getting the names that are from that country.
###### SQL Injections
They are malicious code put into SQL statements and one of the most common web hacking techniques. It can be used to create or change data in a database.
#### Ethical and Legal Implications
###### Code of Ethics
The purpose of the code of ethics is create straightfoward ethical instructions to be honest and trustworthy.
The AUP is used by the public that outlines the organizations policies.
I chose ESPN.com. The website is owned by Disney. One interesting topic is User Generated Content. It's pretty popular topic about not uploading User Generated Content that is defamatory, harassing, threatening, bigoted, hateful, violent, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise offensive or that harms or can reasonably be expected to harm any person or entity, whether or not such material is protected by law. I think most websites have policies very similar to this.

###### Intellectual Property
WIPO is the global forum for intellectual property (IP) services, policy, information and cooperation. 
Once you create something original, it is automatically copyrighted to you. If you want to use it commercially, you must apply through the US copyright office. It would be benificial to copyright my image because if I would ever want to use it, I can. Also, no one else would be able to take it and use it.
That image that is trademarked identifies that the product is made from the company that trademarked it. That protects the company from people taking advantage of using someone elses logo or theme to make sales.
