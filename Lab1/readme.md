### Executive Summary
Week one of the course was just getting started with the very basics. I learned a great bit of history of the computer. I created a GitHub account and got a feel for it. I learned to create a repository, load files to the repository, and edit the repository. Also, learned some markdown language, which I imagine will be used over and over again. 
### Information System Components
The information system component that I use the most often is probably my phone. I own a Samsung Galaxy S7. The hardware is not only the physical phone itself, but also the components inside. Including a processor, memory, and battery. Tons of different software is used on a cell phone like the operating system and pretty much all apps. There is also plenty of data used and stored on a cell phone. Such as, phone numbers, game data, and pictures. I imagine thousands of people are needed to create and produce a cell phone. All the way from creating the operating system to assembly. For every step of the process, there is a person making sure everything is working as it should.
### GitHub
Client-Server Architecture  
The client-server architecture is a network where clients request and recieve services from a server. GitHub Desktop allows for easier and more convienient use of GitHub. 
Cloud Computing
GitHub is considered cloud computing because you can access you account and information from any device. I use Gmail which also uses cloud computing.
