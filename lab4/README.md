#### Executive Summary
This week we have learned more about Python and how to use it. We have written a basic code and learned what each part of it means. We also learned about graphics. Different types of images and what they are used for.

#### Python Idle
The file editor is where the code is written and the shell is the product.
###### Code Examples
Variable - a variable is like a box in the computer's memory that store a single value. A variable can be any single word, underscore, or number as long as it doesn't start with it. An example is the word party. The author uses spam, bacon, and eggs are generic names for examples inspired by Monty Python's Spam Sketch.

Assignment Statement - Assignment statements are used to assign values to variables. An example would be, party = 9.

Function - A function is a statement that performs a certain task. An example of a function would be, print().

Data Types - A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to one data type. Three examples include integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.

#### Graphics

Raster vs Vector Graphics
A raster image is a image that is made up of tiny pixels that are nearly invisable but are more noticable when the image is zoomed in. A raster image can be used for any occasion, as long as the image does not need to be enlarged or zoomed in. Vector images can be any size without losing any quality. They are rendered using a special form of geometry. They are used in professional design settings.

Lossless vs Lossy Compression
Developers need to pay attention because while either can be used, lossy compression can save space by creating smaller file sizes and create images nearly identical to the original.

File Formats
A GIF is different from the others because it allows for animated images. A JPEG uses lossy compression while a PNG image uses lossless compression.

File Properties
I created an image of a logo for an imaginary taco stand that I could own one day. I used 21 layers to create this image. This image is 52.7 KB and opens with photo. One of the options is to use the paint tool which might be useful to maybe edit the image.  


#### Conclusion
This week was a little more "fun". We got to create a basic code and even create an image. I look forward to continue to learn these new tools that will hopefully be helpful in the future.
