### Executive Summary
This week in class we have learned about some of the hardware in a computer and what they do. We have gone over hard drives and solid state drive, memory, the ALU and control unit, the CPU, and input and output devices. We also spent some time learning about the different number systems that a computer can use. We learned to convert deciaml into binary and binary into decimal.
### Hardware
##### Hard Drives
The time it takes a hard drive to physically find the data on the disk is latency. While transfer rates is the speed the data is transferred. Solid state drives are different from traditional hard drives because they don't have any moving parts. They are a series of memory cards that store data that can be retrieves almost instantly. The only down side is they are much more expensive.
##### Memory
Not having enough ram can slow down the device. To run a program, data from the hard drive is loaded into ram first. Then the CPU can read it and run the program. But if the ram doesn't have enough memory, some of the data has to be kept on the slower hard drive. So instead of the data just going from the ram to the CPU, it has to go back to the hard drive which slows down the computer. The difference between a 64 and 32 bit data is that ram can now send 64 bits of data per clock cycle compared to the older versions which could only send 32 bits of data. That means they can now send twice as much data.
##### Alu and the control unit
As explained in the video, the control unit is like a Captain the Army. It will recieve instructions from the ram and then tells other components what to do. One of those components is the ALU. This component does all the mathmatical operations inside the CPU. When the ram sends a command to the control unit to add two numbers, the control unit will break that data down and send it to the ALU to be added. The number it generates is then sent back to the control unit to be sent to ram.
##### CPU, Input, and Output
I am at the self check out at the grocery store. I scan my first item with the scanner. This device is the input. The barcode is scanned and that data is broken down into binary for the CPU to process. The CPU will take data from memory so it will know what to do with the data it just recieved. Then, once the data is processed, the data is sent to the screen to display the item and price I just scanned. That is the output. 
##### Logic Gates and Circuits
A truth table has one column for each input variable and one final column showing the possible results of the operation that the table represents. A NAND gate is the opposite of an AND gate. In an AND gate, all the inputs must be true for the output to be true. In the NAND gate, it output is true when one or more, but not all, of the inputs are false.
##### IEEE - Ethically Alligned Design
The IEEE is nonprofit organization formed to advance technology for the benfit of mankind. They play a significant role in publishing works, sponsoring conferences, accreditation, and standards development. Ethics design is very important in technology as it is in any field. People can use technology for good and bad. It is important that when designing new technology, it is designed to help further mankind and not hinder it.
### Data Representation
##### Numeric Conversions
The decimal number system is the system we use and are familier with. It uses the base power of 10. Binary uses a base power of 2 and hexadecimal uses a base power of 16.
##### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ff016b is the hexadecimal number output for vivid pink. This color could be problematic if the user is color blind. If the text or other information is written in this color, a color blind person might not be able to see it. Also, the color is very bright and can cause strain when looking at it for too long.
